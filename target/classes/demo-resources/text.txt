This window contains text from the file "text.txt" within a 
JAR file placed  in the plugins directory.

The PluginClassLoader handles loading any classes or resources your ImageJ 
plugin may need to run. These classes and resources can now be placed in 
JAR archives to simplify distribution.

How to load resources:

1. To load a resource as a stream (useful for text and config files), use the 
getClass().getResourceAsStream() method. The code used to load this file in 
the demo is shown below:

	InputStream is = getClass().getResourceAsStream("/resources/text.txt");
	InputStreamReader isr = new InputStreamReader(is);

2. To get the URL of a resource (useful for images and binary files), use the 
getClass().getResource() method. The code used to load the image shown below 
is as follows:

	URL url = getClass().getResource("/resources/buenavista.jpg");
	Image image = getToolkit().getImage(url);


The jar file was created using the command

    jar cvfM jar_resources_demo.jar *
